# Personal Data Exposure & Decoy Generator Simulator  
A legal, educational, and privacy‑friendly cyber‑security simulation tool built with **Python + Flask**.

This project simulates how personal information *might appear* in dark‑web leaks and generates large sets of **decoy identities** to demonstrate defensive obfuscation strategies used in real cyber‑security operations.

⚠️ **Important:**  
This project does **not** access the real dark web or transmit data anywhere.  
All results are fully simulated and run **locally** for privacy and legality.

## 🔥 Features

### ✅ 1. Exposure Simulation  
Users enter basic personal data (name, email, phone), and the system generates:
- Simulated leak count  
- Estimated risk score  
- Fake dark‑web sources where exposure *could* appear  

### ✅ 2. Decoy Identity Generator  
To demonstrate obfuscation defense, the system produces:
- 1,000+ fully fake identities  
- Random names, emails, and phone numbers  
- Decoys shown in a table  

### ✅ 3. 100% Local, Safe, and Legal  
- No external requests  
- No real dark‑web interaction  
- Fully offline Flask application
